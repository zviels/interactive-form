# Interactive Form
 
## Project Description

In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form.

I made the form user-friendly by adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivty.

In addition, I validated user input and provided helpful error messages. Those messages show up when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

## Technologies I Have Used

**I did not use any libraries or frameworks in this project!**
