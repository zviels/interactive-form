# Interactive Form

A front end project I built for my portfolio during my studies at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). In this project I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.

Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, I added my own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by -

- Adding conditional behavior and interactivity.
- Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

## Quick Start

To view the app -

- You can [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/zviels/interactive-form/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), extract it and open `index.html`.
- Alternatively, you can watch the app online [here](https://zviels.github.io/interactive-form).

## Overview

As mentioned above, I developed this app as part of my studies at [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com). I participated in their [Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree) program. In this section you can read about -

- The topics I learned before I started developing the app.
- The requirements I had to meet to complete this project.
- Additional features I chose to implement for the app.
- The rating the project received.

### What Did I Learn?

Here is what I learned before I started working on the project -

- The Landscape of JavaScript <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JS%20Course-3659a2" alt="JS Course">

### Project Requirements

You can view the project requirements [here](https://deab9i1yeabp0.cloudfront.net/github/treehouse/interactive-form/project-requirements.jpg).

### Additional Features

These are features I chose to implement for the project, even though I didn't have to. The additional features may extend the functionality of the app, improve the user experience or beautify the user interface.

As of this moment I have implemented two additional features for the app.

- If "Credit Card" is the selected payment method, you have to fill in the card's expiration date. Furthermore, the expiration date must be at least one month later than today.
- On form submission, if the form contains invalid or incomplete information - you will be taken to the top of the page. This way you will be able to fix all the errors from top to bottom.

### Rating

There are two possible grades for each Techdegree project - "Meets Expectations" and "Exceeds Expectations".

This project received the **"Exceeds Expectations"** rating.
