# Interactive Form
 
## Project Description

In this project, I used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form.

I made the form user-friendly by adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivty.

In addition, I validated user input and provided helpful error messages. Those messages show up when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

## Technologies I Have Used

I used only JavaScript to write this project.
**I did not use any libraries or frameworks in this project!**

## My Development Process

### 25/02/2021

- Uploaded starter files.
- On page load, I made the cursor appear in the "Name" field.
- Made the job role text field appear only when the user selects "Other" from the Job Role menu.
- Disabled the "Color" drop down menu when the page loads. It becomes enabled again only when a "Theme" is selected. The drop down menu and the selected option also update correctly when a T-Shirt theme is changed.
- Displayed the total cost of selected activites. The total cost correctly updates in the form when the user selects or deselects activities. I also prevented the user from selecting two activities that take place at the same day and time!
